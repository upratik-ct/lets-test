# Sample Page

## Code Documentation tools:

* [x] Swimm — AI Gen code documentation on its website can be published on GitHub
* [x] Mintlify — Can be used through an Extension on VSCode using AI
* [x] Qodo — Can be used through an Extension on VSCode using AI
* [x] Docuwriter AI — Creates documentation, but can't be published on GitHub
* [x] GitBook — Manual documentation is needed; no AI is used. Create a static site that can be shared.
* [x] Read the books — Works, but with a  specific file structure and yaml, rtd files required in the repo
* [ ] Docusaurus — tried on sandox; issues with output; needs node.js to run
* [ ] Doxygen — Traditional documentation tool
